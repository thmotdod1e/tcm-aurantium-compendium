# Bitter Orange (Aurantium) Clinical Compendium

## Purpose
This repository serves as a living, peer-reviewed clinical compendium on the use of bitter orange (aurantium) in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). It is intended for a small, trusted circle of TCM practitioners to share knowledge, document case studies, and refine best practices.

## Review Process
All contributions must go through a peer-review process before being merged into the main compendium:

1. **Issue Creation**: Identify a knowledge gap or new topic, and create a GitHub Issue to track research and discussion.
2. **Branch Development**: Create a feature branch, draft content, and cite sources (classical texts, modern research, clinical notes).
3. **Pull Request**: Submit a Pull Request (PR) with the new content, linking to the relevant Issue.
4. **Peer Review**: At least one other practitioner reviews the PR, leaving inline comments for clarification, accuracy, and safety.
5. **Iteration**: The author addresses all review comments with edits until the reviewer approves.
6. **Merge**: Once approved, the PR is merged (preferably with squash) into the main branch.
7. **Release**: Periodically, stable versions are tagged as Releases for clinical reference.
