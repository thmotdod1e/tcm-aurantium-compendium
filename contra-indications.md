# Contraindications & Safety of Bitter Orange (Aurantium)

## General Safety Profile
Bitter orange (aurantium) is generally considered safe when used appropriately in TCM formulations. However, due to its sympathomimetic constituents, it may pose risks in certain populations and when combined with certain medications.

## Interactions with Antihypertensive Medications

### Active Compounds of Concern
The primary adrenergic compounds in bitter orange are **synephrine** and **octopamine**. These alkaloids act as α‑adrenergic and β‑adrenergic agonists, leading to increased heart rate, vasoconstriction, and elevated blood pressure (Bensky et al., 2004; Tang et al., 2008). The dried immature fruit (zhi shi, Citrus aurantium L.) contains higher concentrations of these amines than the ripe peel (zhi ke).

### Pharmacodynamic Interactions
1. **Beta‑blockers (e.g., propranolol, metoprolol)**
   - Synephrine may competitively antagonize beta‑blockade, reducing antihypertensive efficacy.
   - Case reports suggest potential for tachycardia and hypertensive episodes when bitter orange supplements are taken with non‑selective beta‑blockers (Firenzuoli et al., 2005).

2. **ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril, enalapril)**
   - No direct pharmacokinetic interaction known.
   - However, the pressor effect of synephrine could counteract the blood‑pressure‑lowering effect, necessitating closer monitoring.

3. **Calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine, nifedipine)**
   - Additive vasodilation may theoretically lead to orthostatic hypotension, but clinical evidence is lacking.
   - Conversely, synephrine‑induced vasoconstriction might offset the antihypertensive benefit.

4. **Diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide)**
   - Sympathomimetic activity may exacerbate electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia) and increase arrhythmia risk.

5. **Central α‑agonists (e.g., clonidine)**
   - Synephrine may antagonize central sympatholytic action, potentially causing rebound hypertension.

### Clinical Recommendations
- **Avoid concurrent use** of bitter orange (especially high‑dose extracts) with non‑selective beta‑blockers and in patients with poorly controlled hypertension.
- If combination is unavoidable, advise patients to:
  - Monitor blood pressure and heart rate daily for the first two weeks.
  - Report palpitations, dizziness, or chest discomfort immediately.
  - Use the lowest effective dose of aurantium (e.g., ≤ 6 g/day of dried peel in decoction).
  - Prefer preparations of the ripe peel (zhi ke) over the immature fruit (zhi shi) when possible, as the former contains lower levels of synephrine.
- **Contraindicated** in patients with pheochromocytoma, severe coronary artery disease, or history of ventricular arrhythmias.

### Evidence Quality
- **Classical texts**: Bencao Gangmu notes that zhi shi “should be used with caution in patients with excess fire and rising yang,” which may correspond to hypertensive tendencies.
- **Modern evidence**: Limited human trials; most data derived from animal studies, in‑vitro experiments, and case reports of adverse events with bitter‑orange‑containing weight‑loss supplements (Haller et al., 2005).

## Precautions for Special Populations
### Pregnancy & Lactation
- Insufficient safety data; avoid use unless under supervision of a qualified TCM practitioner.

### Pediatric & Elderly Patients
- Reduced hepatic clearance may increase risk of sympathomimetic side effects; lower doses recommended.

### Renal or Hepatic Impairment
- Metabolism of synephrine may be altered; monitor for adverse effects.
